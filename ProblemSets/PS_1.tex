Hi,

I am an Economics undergrad student with a Computer Science minor. I was Chemical Engineering/Pre-Med half of college, but I've always kind of known data science is actually the field I want to enter. I'm on my 4th data-related internship. My first one was as a Database Developer at American Fidelity, then a Data Analyst at BOK Financial, a Data Scientist at Exaptive, and currently as a Data Engineer/Scientist at Sonic Drive-In. I'm not sure about what project I want to do yet. I thought this class would be interesting because I haven't been able to take a data science-related class up until now. Learning the material in an academic setting (rather than business) is something I'm looking forward to. My plan after graduation is to take a job as a data scientist or data engineer.
