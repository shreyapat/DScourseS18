\maketitle{#5}\\
What is the dimension of your training data (housing.train)?\\
404 ints because the dimension of housing.train is [1:404]
\newline

\maketitle{#6}\\
What is the optimal value of lambda?\\
0.00288.\\

What is the in-sample RMSE?\\
0.1881683.\\

What is the out-of-sample RMSE (i.e. the RMSE in the test data)?\\
0.2173507
\newline

\maketitle{#7}\\
What is the optimal value of lambda now?\\
0.00314.\\

What is the in-sample RMSE?\\
0.1899243.\\

What is the out-of-sample RMSE (i.e. the RMSE in the test data)?\\
0.1913142.
\newline

\maketitle{#8}\\
What are the optimal values of lambda and alpha after doing 6-fold cross validation?\\
0.00606.\\
0.582.\\

What is the in-sample RMSE?\\
0.2008356.\\

What is the out-of-sample RMSE?\\
s 0.1913142.\\

Does the optimal value of alpha lead you to believe that you should use LASSO or ridge regression for this prediction task?\\

\newline

\maketitle{#9}\\
Why you would not be able to estimate a simple linear regression model on the housing.train dataframe.\\


Using the RMSE values of each of the tuned models in the previous three questions, comment on where your model stands in terms of the bias-variance tradeoff.\\
