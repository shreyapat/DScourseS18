\section{Introduction}


For this assignment I used a data set I have worked with once before. It contains the scores of 80 pupils in the following subjects: geometry, reading, grammar, drawing, calculus, history, writing, and spelling.

I cut the data down to the first 6 rows to make it easier to work with. Then, I did a cbind on each subject. Out of all the subjects given, the least impactful given the proportion of variance were taken out. Next, I did that one stop further until only three columns remaied and that was interesting.

The images shown here show how each subject relates to the other. Additionally, the bar graphs are good for comparing very small numbers.
